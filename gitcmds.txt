COMMANDS IN GIT :

1) git init : Initialise the git 

STAGING AREA : The middle layer where all files can be chosen for commit or other activities 

2) git status : check commit activities , view STAGING AREA 

3) git add filename.type : to add foriengn file to staging area 

4) git commit -m "msg"  : To save a file  

5) git log : view all commit actions made in repository 

6) git checkout : to revert back or roll back to a particular version of repository  

7) git remote add origin <<url from github>>  : to link your local repository and internet remote repository 
   git push -u origin main 
 
8) GIT IGNORE FILES are usually meant for storing data which you dont want to expose just like api keys or pwds etc 
   When you have already added all files to staging area with commit action and want to remove files and add to git ignore use cmd: 
   " git rm --cached -r . "


   It gitignore file , we can use '#' sign for comments , *.<file type>  for wild pattern 
      Eg :  *.txt will add all txt files to gitignore 

9) Branching is an important tool for developers who make different features and working on different sections of same project. 
   to make a new branch we have a command called as : 
    git branch <branch-name> 

10) To go and make changes to a particular branch , we need to initially go that particular branch area 
      To do this task , we need to type the command : 
      git checkout <branch-name> 
      Then we can go and modify what we need apart from the main branch commited files. Anything modified will be meant only 
      for the branch it is lyong on and not on whole repository. 
      after doing changes , we can normally follow commands of git add , git coomit ..  to save the changes to the branch.
      Further, to view how many branches you have, we can use the command "git branch" .

11) Merge : when you are with the new feature or work of a branch you can simply make it into main branch using merge command as :
      git merge sunday  (caution : after going into main branch) 

12) To push the local files into remote repository : 
      git push origin main -u
